Learn to build a mini Ethereum Virtual Machine from scratch with this open-source educational book. Built with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

You can read the book here: [evm-from-scratch.app](https://evm-from-scratch.app/content/01_intro.html)

## Overview

We'll build the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from scratch, step-by-step. Each major topic is covered in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

At the end, we'll combine all the building blocks we've created to assemble the mini EVM.

You can view these notebooks directly on GitHub or download the repository to run and experiment with them locally.

## Video Series

A video series covering these topics is coming soon and will be uploaded to my (shafu) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI9MdYsFm9h7W9jyP6Uxxbw).

## Local Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python and pip

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
jupyter-book build .
```

Open \_build/html/index.html in your browser to view the book locally.
